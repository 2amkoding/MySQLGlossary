## Classify Orders table into 2 categories: 'Active' and 'Archived'.
## 'Active' = orders placed in current year

## previous  methods: 
##      1. Two SELECT satements, 1 for active orders, 1 for archive, 
##      2. combine table using UNION operator

## using IF
IF(expression, first, second)

SELECT
    order_id,
    order_date,
    IF(YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(NOW()), 'Active',  'Archived')
        AS category
FROM orders


## Write a query to produce a result of  4  columns: product_id, name, orders, frequency
## if orders > 1, frequency = 'Many Times' else 'Once'

## step1: Get product_id, name from products table
SELECT
    product_id,
    name
FROM products table

## step2: Create a column to display number of orders  by joining order_items  from orders table
SELECT
    product_id,
    name,
    COUNT(*) AS orders
FROM products table
JOIN order_items USING (product_id)
GROUP BY product,id, name

## step3: create a column 'frequency'
SELECT
    product_id,
    name,
    COUNT(*) AS orders,
    IF(COUNT(*) >1,  'Many  times', 'Once')  AS frequency
FROM products table
JOIN order_items USING (product_id)
GROUP BY product,id, name
