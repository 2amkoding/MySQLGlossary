## Views is a powerful tool to save common queries to use later.
## Views do not store data, however can be manipulated same way as tables.

USE sql_invoicing;

CREATE VIEW sales_by_client AS
SELECT
	c.client_id,
    c.name,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS  total_sales
FROM clients c
JOIN invoices i USING (client_id)
GROUP BY client_id, name

## Create a View AS  clients_balance
## See the balance for each client
## columns: client_id, name, balance

## step1
SELECT *
FROM clients c
JOIN invoices i USING (client_id)

## step2
SELECT 
	c.client_id,
    c.name,
    invoice_total - payment_total AS balance
FROM clients c
JOIN invoices i USING (client_id)

## step3
SELECT 
	c.client_id,
    c.name,
    SUM(invoice_total - payment_total) AS balance
FROM clients c
JOIN invoices i USING (client_id)
GROUP BY client_id, name

## step4
